Click the green button labeled "Create codespace on main". (You may instead see a "+" icon to create the codespace.)

When you start the codespace you will initially see this while it loads:

Be patient! After a few (typically about 3-5) minutes you will see:

Click the red asterisk-like Claude icon above the main central window:

__IMPORTANT:__ if you see a box asking you to log in, IGNORE IT - just wait a few seconds and it will go away.

You will then see something like this:
